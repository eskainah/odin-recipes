    <h1>Liberian Traditional Recipes</h1>
    <p>
        Before we dive into our recipes for today, I figure out that it will be best
        if I give you a brief history about the Liberian people. <br> The people of 
        Liberia are classified into three major groups: the indigenous people, who 
        are in the majority and who migrated <br> from the western Sudan in the late Middle 
        Ages; Black immigrants from the United States (known historically as Americo-Liberians) <br>
        and the West Indies; and other Black immigrants from neighbouring western African 
        states who came during the anti-slave-trade <br> campaign and European colonial rule. <br><br>

        Now let's get into our business of the day. Below are some of the popular meals of the liberian people.
